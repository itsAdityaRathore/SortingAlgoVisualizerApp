# sorting_algo_visualizer

A new Flutter project..

## What is this about..?

This project make you visually understand how sorting alogrithms works and how sorting is done in real time.
Developed with Flutter as a front-end and Dart in backend where the alogrithm process the data and and display as a Bar Chart.

## How to Use

1. User has to select a range(length) of the array using the slider.
2. Select the Sorting Algo you want to visualize in realtime.
3. Press the play button. And Enjoy..!!

## How it Works?

As the user selects the array size with the slider a random array is generated of the same length. Then user has to select the sorting algorithm he wish to visualize from the carousal slider. Each Algo is assigned with an index value, as user slides it the index value is updated. Then the final step is to push the Play button. The random array is converted in the form suitable to create a bar chart out of it i.e. with x and y values. Every time a value is swapped after comparision the entire array is updated with the swapped value. As the array updates the Bar Chart is re built and thus providing a visual representation of how sorting algo works.
